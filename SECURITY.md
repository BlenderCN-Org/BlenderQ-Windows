# Security Policy

Blender Q security is one of the project's top priorities.  There are not a lot of threats with this software, as it is a rather simple and niche project.  Still, it's important to take care of security issues. 

## Supported Versions

The latest version will always get the newest security updates.  Since there is not an automatic update, and this is a small project, previous versions may not recieve updates.
